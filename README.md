# Mellon
A simple and friendly reminder bot

Mellon is designed the help the lazy and forgetful folks, like myself.

Itâ€™s idea is to tell it when a certain event is gonna happen and set how much you want to be reminded of this event. 

For example, lets say you have a really hard exam next month, and need to remember to study every weekend for this exam, you could ask Mellon to remind you to do so every Saturday at 2pm.

Mellon can also greet you every morning with the list of events that will happen during the day, just to make sure you will remember.

Mellon will try to reach you using Telegram, so, its important to follow the instructions and connect your account with a Telegram account and say hi to Mellon in Telegram.
